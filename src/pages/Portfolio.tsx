        I started coding in 2021 with a bootcamp that taught me a{' '}
        <span className="font-semibold">bunch</span> of technologies in a
        relatively short amount of time after my full time day job. Fully
        motivated, I blazed through the program hoping to transition to tech
        asap. Little did I know though, learning to code takes time and practice
        and after diving into frontend, backend, different frameworks and
        libraries, at the end of it all, my head was spinning and I realized:{' '}
        <i>Hey, what the.. I still cannot code</i>
        ...
        <br />
        The concepts remained foreign to me, the syntax was shaky at best and my
        ability to understand what I was doing was close to nil.
        <br />
        <br />I finished the bootcamp, but did not feel ready at all and was
        left with only one choice: Dedicate a few months to learning coding for
        real without any distractions. I had already peeked into how a lot of
        this was supposed to work and I really enjoyed frontend work and working
        with React. So I set out to <i>teach myself</i> this time around and I
        am happy to say I feel great about my progress now as opposed to after
        the bootcamp. I took away a lot from it still, so without further ado,
        here's me showing off what I learned and produced during it.
